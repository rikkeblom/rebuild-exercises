## Title: Border content

### Rules

- You may _NOT_ make changes to "index.html"
- You may only make changes to "css/style.css"

### Exercise description

In this exercise your job is to create a border around content, which is divided into two columns. The content itself (i.e., comprising of a `header` and a `article` element) has a maximum width of `60rem` while the background color of each column stretches to the edges of the viewport. On smaller screen sizes (below a width of `36rem`) the content must stack whilst respecting the background color of each section (see video reference).
